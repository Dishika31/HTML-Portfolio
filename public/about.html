<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I am Dishika. I am 24 years old. I love to learn new things and am starting my journey on learning web development from scratch. </p>

<p>This is my portfolio website which showcases some of the projects I have created so far. </p>


<p>Apart from this, I am also doing my master's in Computer Engineering right now. I am in my last year of studies. When I am not studying, you can find me doing something creative. I love scrapbooking and I also enjoy doing yoga.</p>
