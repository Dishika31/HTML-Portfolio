 <h1>Must Watch movies according to Dishika</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Devil Wears Prada</h3>
 <img src="../assets/images/the-devil-wears-prada.jpg" width="250"/>
 <p>This is the ultimate feel-good girly movie you can ever watch. If you are a typical girl who loves fashion and 
    dressing up, this movie is for you. It shows how an average day is like in a top fashion magazine with a stuck-up
    boss who wants nothing but perfection.

 <h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
 <img src="../assets/images/znmd.jpg" width="250"/>
 <p>This movie is one of the most liberating movies of all time. It reminds you that 
    life is all about doing the things that you really love before it is too late. The movie throws light on the
    journey of 3 best friends completely different from each other all set for a road trip together. By the end, they
    learn major life lessons that change their lives for the better.</p>
    <hr />
 <h3>Maze Runner</h3>
 <img src="../assets/images/maze-runner.jpg" width="250"/>
 <p>This movie is a trilogy. It is the perfect series to watch if you want a really good thriller. 
    It keeps you hooked throughout the movie waiting eagerly for what comes next. This movie surrounds a maze which
     opens every day with new routes and about 25 people stuck on one side of the maze in desperate need of an escape
    route.</p>
